# github-favourites
An app that allows accessing, displaying, and favouriting repository data from the github api using React, Redux, and GraphQl

Download or Clone the project to your local machine and then install the dependencies.

'''
npm install
'''

You will need to create a .env file in the root directory and add a github token. More information on how to do this is available here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/

In you .env file, add the token:

'''
GITHUB_TOKEN=[Your-token-here]
'''

Now run the project from the command line using the webpack dev server:

'''
npm run dev-server
'''

Happy repository fetching!
